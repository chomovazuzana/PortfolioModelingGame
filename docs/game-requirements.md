## Investment Game: The Returns Challenge

Participants are invited to allocate a total amount (e.g. EUR 100,000) across five main investment categories for each year (2021-2024). The goal is for the total value of their portfolio at the end of the period to come as close as possible to the value of an "ideal" portfolio that had the optimal allocation each year.

## Game Rules

- **Initial Capital**: All players start with the same initial capital (e.g. EUR 100,000) at the beginning of 2021.
- **Asset Allocation**: At the beginning of each year, players must decide how to allocate 100% of their assets across the five categories: Cash, Bonds, Equities, Commodities, REITs.
- **Returns**: At the end of each year, the player's portfolio is adjusted based on actual market returns.
- **Winner**: The winner is the player who, at the end of 2024, has the highest total portfolio value.
